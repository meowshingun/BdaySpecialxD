          <p>Hello my dear Lakshmi ji 💖,</p>

          <p>
            First of all, wishing you a <strong>veryyyyy happyyyyy birthdayyyyyyyy 🎉🎂💫</strong><br>
            May your day be as beautiful, soft, and special as you are 🥰
          </p>

          <p>
            Secondly, thank you <strong>sooooo much</strong> for coming into my life, babyy 💕  
            I’m genuinely so grateful to have you in my life. Honestly, it was all so unexpected —
            from being just friends to becoming a couple 💗✨
          </p>

          <p>
            Confessing my feelings to you was one of the <strong>best decisions</strong> of my life 🫶  
            From that day onwards, my life completely changed.
            I went from being the loneliest person to the happiest one 🥹💞
          </p>

          <p>
            And listen carefully — I never, ever thought of leaving you, and I never will.  
            You are my <strong>cutie patooty Lakshmi ji 🐾💖</strong>, my safe place, my happiness.
          </p>

          </blockquote>

          <p>
            There are still sooo many surprises left for you, and I’ll give them to you
            one by one 😼🎁💗  
            This is just the beginning.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once again, wishing you a <strong>very very happy birthday 🎀🎂</strong><br>
            I love you <strong>always and foreverrrr</strong>, babyy 💞  
            Enjoy your day to the fullest 🌸✨
